// button for saving is the same in places => might import
// consider modularizing in general
// theme for tailwind => decide on colors, text, font, etc

// centralize errors on FE, for example when a repinse could be empty/und?
// possibly on BE too => cover all async func's and actions

// look into build problems

// error boundaries in React to handle errors in UI components

// resuable buttons => need to modularize then import them?
  // cancel button, save button

// workout modal changes
// bring in api for user to select exercise name and that name is sent to backend => so user types into a search bar and that narrows down selection
// default 0 entry for reps and weight if not provided by user and they save, if a workout is selected
// data flow => user clicks button => redirected to another page with search bar and full exercise list, maybe genres/body parts => user clicks one adn that is what is sent to backend
// => backend creates an entry in the database with values for 0 in each spot for reps and weight, 
// FE refreshes when user saves the name and opens up the edit form for the new set just added under the new exercise

// lazy loading for not having to fetch ALL exercise whe nthe user loads in just some
// debouncing for only searching when the suer is done typing => delay of a second maybe after the user is done typing, then search
// caching recent user entered exercise => could just be the last XXX amount of exercises entered into teh db for that user
// 
// maybe add a feature when an excercse is hovered have an option for more info
  // show an image , video of exercise, external like to youtube based on exercise selected
    // prompt user with auth info or use for signing in the first place

// bug - selected date when calendar modal is open is the color of the bg
  // also consider styling on this in general
  // maybe a drag and drop into a trash can 
  // make buttons smaller?

// spacing between end of screen and workouts, between exercises, and button positioning
