// resuable buttons => need to modularize then import them?
  // cancel button, save button
// consider modularizing in general
// theme for tailwind => decide on colors, text, font, etc

// lazy loading for not having to fetch ALL exercise whe nthe user loads in just some
// debouncing for only searching when the suer is done typing => delay of a second maybe after the user is done typing, then search
